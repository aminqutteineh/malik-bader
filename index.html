            Born In Chicago. Southside. What’s it mean… not sure. See cops and thieves like the same. Learn write and read from the same. It’s elevated underground. First scene music. Throwing parties at 16. Party Crew Nasty Boys. Dj battles all over places. Mixtape King. Jeru Da Daja and Gangstarr at 18. Throw them parties and make a name. Then came film. Short ones. Self Taught. Win big. Mortgage the house what can you do with a Klondike bar. 100k. Make a film. Shoot super 16. Everyone thinks its real. Tribeca doc in competition. “excuse me sirs but it aint real” It’s still in. and then what nothing. do it again. This time with a friend. We CASH ONLY. another 200k. Another good run. Best Director, Thanks Fantasia. Critics Pic, thanks New York Times again. Fest in far places. It still not easy. Nobody does you a favor. Still an outsider. Maybe the color. Maybe the cousins. Maybe the clubs only for sundance lab brothers. Here is soemthing I cant understand - how I could make Killerman. 23 days shoulda listened to Ken when he said 40. Now i’m thinking and yearning to connect with my Identity. Save my father his shame. Son never tell them your name. I’m Mike not Mohamed. What is it? Who are we? Writing a good story. It will be the first journey. The others were only a story. We’re having fun. Articulate a vision. Life is beautiful if only to see another smile. Happy being unhappy. Let’s do it again.
